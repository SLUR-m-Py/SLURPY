## ----------------------------------------- LOAD IN MODULES ------------------------------------------ ## 
## Load time and sys mods 
import time, sys 

## Load in date and time
from datetime import datetime

## load in write to file from our pysamtools 
from pysamtools import writetofile

## ------------------------------------------ Input Variables ------------------------------------------ ##
## Gather the file name, the start time stamp from input and calculate the end time stamp 
filename,sstamp,estamp = sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2]), round(time.time())

## Calculate delta of time stamps and then the approx run time
runtime = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(estamp - sstamp).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S').split(' ')[-1]

## Write the timestamp to file 
writetofile(filename,[f'START TIME: {sstamp}\n',f'END TIME: {estamp}\n',f'RUN TIME: {runtime}'],False)
## End of file
