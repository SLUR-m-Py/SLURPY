# SLUR(M)-PY
[SLUR(M)-py: A SLURM Powered Pythonic Pipeline for Parallel Processing of 3D (Epi)genomic Profiles](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.18.594827v3)

## Setting up the computing environment
SLUR(M)-py (pronounced slurpy) was developed using anaconda (python v 3.10.13) for a linex OS on a high-performance computing cluster. 
We recommend using conda to manage the python environment needed by SLUR(M)-py. 

The easiest way to set up the needed computing environment is via conda and the listed [envirnoment.yml](https://github.com/SLUR-m-Py/SLURPY/blob/main/environment.yml) file. The conda command below will make the environment named "bioenv" from the environment.yml file.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Alternative setup instructions
Below are commands needed to set up the "bioenv" manually for running SLUR(M)-py. 

```
## Make a python environment named bioenv 
conda create -n bioenv 

## Activate the environment
conda activate bioenv 

## After making a new conda environment install needed packages.
## Use conda to install needed mods, and bring in mods from bioconda
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn dask biopython pysam samtools bwa -c bioconda 
```

### Troubleshooting Installation of MACS for peak calling
For calling peaks in ATAC-seq and narrow peak ChIP-seq data sets we use [macs3](https://macs3-project.github.io/MACS/) (the latest version of [macs2](https://pypi.org/project/MACS2/)). We recommend installing macs3 via pip (shown below). 

```
pip install macs3
```

A full list of the python libraries and their versions used to develop slurpy are listed within [python.dependencies.txt](https://github.com/SLUR-m-Py/SLURPY/blob/main/python.dependencies.txt).

## Installation of SLUR(M)-py
Downloading the repository as a .zip archive is easiest. For developers a simple clone command with git works too:

```
git clone https://github.com/SLUR-m-Py/SLURPY.git
```

Once slurpy is downloaded (and expanded), change the current directory to the local SLURPY directory and modify the python files as executables. 

```
cd ./SLURPY
chmod +x *.py 

```

## Dependencies 
Slurpy utilizes SLURM and was developed under version 21.08.8-2. 
The suit of tools in [samtools](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/samtools) is also required with the minimum version of 1.15.1. 

### The sort function
New testing on the duplication step of SLUR(M)-py showed high memory usage and low speed when processing very large, human datasets; this often led to crashes on smaller nodes. To correct this, we implemented a new deduplication algorithm in SLUR(M)-py that utilizes the Linex core utility’s function [sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_(Unix)) to quickly sort (by chromosome and position) bedpe files for deduplication. This [new script](https://github.com/SLUR-m-Py/SLURPY/blob/main/deduphic.py) is currently the most memory efficient implementation we could integrate into SLUR(M)-py. We are assuming the sort function is already installed in our SLURM/Linex environment.

### Troubleshooting, fastp install. 
For splitting intial input read pairs into subsets for parallele processing we use [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp).
It is expected, that the fastp executable can be installed within the python/conda environment (shown above, at the top of this document). 
However, should this fail, the executable can be downloaded and added to the current path (shown below). 

```
## Change directorys
cd ./SLURPY

## download the latest build, you may need to install wget
conda install wget
wget http://opengene.org/fastp/fastp

## Modify the executable with chmod
chmod a+x ./fastp

## Check that fastp works
./fastp -h

## Add the fastp to path within a ~/.bashrc file
export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/fastp>

```

Alternatively, fastp can be installed via a conda command.
This step is not needed if the creation of the conda environment (shown above) works. 
```
## Install latest version of fastp
conda install bioconda::fastp
```

### juicer tools (optional)
Here we currently use Juicer tools (specifically the juicer pre command) to process and format penultimate forms of Hi-C data (.bedpe) into a final .hic file. 
The juicer jar files are hosted on the downloads page of the [juicer github](https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki/Download). 
Downloading a jar file into the SLURPY directory makes calls to format .hic data easier (shown later). 

```
## Move the jar file into the slurpy directory
mv juicer_tools_1.22.01.jar ./SLURPY
```

## Checking the python environment 
Once within the slrupy directory, we can check if the computing environment has all the needed python libraries using the [myecho.py](https://github.com/SLUR-m-Py/SLURPY/blob/main/myecho.py) script.

```
## Activate the computing environment
conda activate bioenv
## Check all our needed python libs are there
python myecho.py
```

If the environment was created successfully the script will run to completion and print the following:

```
INFO: Modules loaded correctly.
INFO: We are ready to run slurpy!
```

## Running slurpy, examples
### Setting up a project directory
Currently the ATAC- and ChIP-seq protocols are fully functional. To run slurpy, change the current directory to the target project (in the example below, the project is named 2501_001) and soft link to the path of the slurpy executables.

```
cd /path/to/project/directory/2501_001
ln -s /path/to/SLURPY
```

Within the project directory ensure the paired fastqs are listed or linked within a subdirectory 
“./fastqs”. 

```
ls -l ./fastqs/*.fastq.gz
```

The pairs fastq files must be gzipped (.gz) and the file must end with the extension ".fastq.gz". 
The fastq files with in the fastq directory must have the first and second reads in pair marked with "R1" and "R2" surronded by underlines (see below.)
The first in pair must also be first when listed within the directory.

```
ls -l ./fastqs/*.gz

example_sample_1_R1_0001.fastq.gz
example_sample_2_R2_0001.fastq.gz

```

### Envoking slurpy for Hi-C processing
The help menu (-h) of protocols within slurpy lists all the available arguments and default settings. Be sure to activate the conda environment "bioenv". 
```
## Activate our computing environment
conda activate bioenv 

## Start a run of the slurpy pipeline, providing a fasta file of a reference genome
./SLURPY/slurm.py -r /path/to/reference/file.fasta

## Call the help menu to see all the arugments and parameters

```
### For ATAC-seq experiments
To call the peaks.py script within the slurpy pipeline to analyze an ATAC-seq experiment and save output to .bam format:

```
./SLURPY/slurm.py -r /path/to/reference/file.fasta --atac-seq --bam
```

### For ChIP-seq experiments 
To run slurpy to analyze a ChIP-seq experiment run:

```
./SLURPY/slurm.py -r /path/to/reference/file.fasta -c /path/to/control/or/input.bam --atac-seq
```

## Other scripts

### Determining completeness 
The [checkwork.py](https://github.com/SLUR-m-Py/SLURPY/blob/main/checkwork.py) script can be used to determine if a run of the SLUR(M)-py pipeline. If warnings or error messages are found within any of the logs this script will report it. 

```
## Check if our run of SLUR(M)-py worked.
$ ./SLURPY/checkwork.py
INFO: Good news everyone! No errors were detected in this run.
        :-) 
        <3
```

### Cleaning up old files after a completed run
After a completed run of SLUR(M)-py, large, temporary files can be removed using the same [checkwork.py](https://github.com/SLUR-m-Py/SLURPY/blob/main/checkwork.py) script but by passing "clean" as an input (shown below).
```
## Remove large files.
./SLURPY/cleanup.py clean
```

### Reseting a run
If a run of slur(m)-py needs to be removed, say so it may be rerun from the raw fastq files, the same [checkwork.py](https://github.com/SLUR-m-Py/SLURPY/blob/main/checkwork.py) script will completely reset the working directory by passing "reset" as an input (shown below).
```
## Remove large files.
./SLURPY/cleanup.py reset
```

### Caluclating a memory profile
SLUR(M)-py has two arguments to control RAM usage, the “--memory”  and the “–xmx” inputs, which control the maximum memory across any processes submitted to SLURM and the amount of memory allocated to Java, used in .hic file creation by juicer’s pre command (respectively). By default, the memory argument is not set. To help set this argument, from a completed run of SLUR(M)-py, a profile of the memory usage per process within the pipeline can be calculated using the [memoryprofile.py](https://github.com/SLUR-m-Py/SLURPY/blob/main/memoryprofile.py) script. This script is automatically called after a run of SLUR(M)-py, generating a memory profile for the run.

```
## Call the memory profile script, no arguments are needed. 
./SLURPY/memoryprofile.py
```
