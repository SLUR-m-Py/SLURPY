## ----------------------------------------- LOAD IN MODULES ------------------------------------------ ## 
## Load time and sys mods 
import time, sys 

## Load in date and time
from datetime import datetime

## load in write to file from our pysamtools 
from .defaults.tools.pysamtools import writetofile

## ------------------------------------------ Input Variables ------------------------------------------ ##
## Gather the file name, the start time stamp from input and calculate the end time stamp 
filename,sstamp,estamp = sys.argv[1], float(sys.argv[2]), time.time()

## Format the start time stamp 
dt1 = datetime.fromtimestamp(sstamp)

## Format the end time stamp
dt2 = datetime.fromtimestamp(estamp)

## Calculate delta of time stamps and then the approx run time
runtime = dt2 - dt1 
#runtime = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(estamp - sstamp).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S').split(' ')[-1]

## Write the timestamp to file 
writetofile(filename,['START TIME: %s %s\n'%(dt1,sstamp),'END TIME: %s %s\n'%(dt2,estamp),'RUN TIME: %s %s\n'%(runtime,' ')],False)
